### Governing Board Representative
#### Summary Overview
Premier Members may appoint one representative to the Governing Board. The foundation's General Members may annually elect one representative to the Governing Board. Please see CHARTER.md for additional details. Included below are suggested behaviors for effective board members. 

1. Strategic mindset: Strong board members develop a deep understanding of the CDF's strategic direction and help drive key decisions to maximize the project's chance of success. Familiarity with technology and industry is required to be able to understand the nuances of the project, but Board Members do NOT have to be developers or CTOs. Prior experience with Open Source projects and/or standards is definitely a plus.

2. Communication and gravitas: A great board member combines openness to others' points of view with an ability to be highly persuasive, thereby driving consensus. They are influential both within their own organizations and in the broader industry.

3. Involvement: A helpful board member not only attends all/most board meetings, but is also responsive to the CDF leadership, actively reviews materials presented, and participates in sub-committees. Specific expertise in one of Marketing, Finance, Open Source IP, or governance is highly valued as it allows the board member to lead a sub-committee. Board members will occasionally be tasked in taking the lead in a project, or to represent the project externally.
