# CDF Strategic Goals 

As a result of the board brainstorm session for the CD Foundation on August 13th at DevOps world, the outcome of the meeting was to hone in on the top priorities the board would like to see as the focus for the year.  Please find the brainstorm deck in the link below:

Based on this, we would like to bring the goals to the Governing Board attention for review and we can work towards prioritizing the goals for the CDF staff to begin shaping the program and executing. 

The goals will be routinely revisited and updated for each year. A blog post detailing the activity kick-off is located on the CDF blog: https://cd.foundation/blog/2019/10/17/cdfs-governing-board-unveils-9-strategic-goals/
