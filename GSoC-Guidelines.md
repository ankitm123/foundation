## How to Participate
Google Summer of Code
[Submit the application](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works)


### Things to Note 

**This is the process to follow provided by previous CDF Project applicants when applying for GSoC (timelines are subject to change, check the timeline section in the gsoc webpage).**

* Publish a blog post announcing [Project] interest in applying to GSoC when the application is announced by Google
this normally happens in November
* Set a deadline when all project ideas are submitted for internal review by [Project] TOC
* It’s a good idea to set the deadline internally for project list submission to February 1. This is normally when the application opens for organizations. The application remain open only for 2 weeks, so it’s better to have a list beforehand.
* Decide internally on a list of projects and the mentors that are interested.
* Projects with multiple mentors are more likely to be shortlisted
* Once the application is announced by Google, publish a blog post with the project ideas. 


If selected by GSoC (results are announced in March), publish a follow up blog post.

It helps the contributors and the mentors if a project template is provided.
After the project proposal deadline (April), decide on a list of contributors and rank the project proposals (the one at the top is the strongest proposal)
Once Google announces the list of accepted proposals for [Project] (not all proposals ranked will get selected), mentors should discuss the project details (and time commitments) with the contributors.

## How to set up a Payoneer account
Google uses Payoneer to pay Google Summer of Code Contributors and Organizations. Payoneer is a fast and convenient way to receive payments globally.
Included in your payment is $500 per GSoC contributor for your organization called the 'org stipend'. One payment is sent to the org, and if the org wishes to disburse the funds to their mentors they are welcome to do that on their own.
We kindly ask that you review and act on the following information:
Please submit the GSoC Payment Request Form to https://members.cd.foundation/  (please allow 5 days processing time)
Please understand that LF will receive the GSoCfunds for your project directly to our Payoneer's account, then we can disburse the funds once received.
