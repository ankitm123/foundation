## Election Timeline and Nominations
### Create an election timeline
Depending on a Project’s charter, an election timeline may include a nomination period, an evaluation period, a qualification period, and a voting period.
The length of each period may be defined in the charter
Leave at least a week in between each period
Example: 
* Project Election Timeline:
* Call for nominations: Tuesday, December 5th Noon PT
* End of call for nominations: Tuesday, December 12th Noon PT
* A ballot will be distributed to the Voting/Primary Member on: Thursday, December 14th
* Voting occurs by a time-limited Condorcet ranking in CIVS: December 14-20
* The election will be completed on: Wednesday, December 20th Noon PT, election results are announced

### Identify Nominating Body
Note: Ensure all Primary Voting contacts exist in either a spreadsheet or a mailing list

#### Governing Board
Based on membership tier (Silver, Gold, etc) or involvement in Project community (Developer/Maintainer)
For membership-based seats, the primary voting contact for each member may nominate and vote
For Developer or Maintainer seats, Project maintainers can nominate or vote, as dictated by a Project’s charter or election policies
Number of seats per class is typically defined in the Project charter

#### Technical Committee (TOC, TSC, TAC)
GB-selected - anyone can nominate but GB members qualify candidates and vote
TOC-selected - existing TOC members nominate and vote
Maintainer-selected - Project maintainers nominate and vote
End user-selected - Project end user members nominate and vote

#### Chair Election
Members of the board or committee can nominate themselves and each member can submit a vote
